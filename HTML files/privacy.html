        <div class="Introduction">
            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                We value the trust you place in us when you provide your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains
                how we collect, use, store, and protect your data in line with the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)
                of South Africa. Our primary purpose is to assist you in applying for educational opportunities, bursaries, scholarships,
                and other student-related services. We do not use your data for any other purposes beyond the scope of assisting you with applications.<br/><br/>

                This document is meant to reassure you that your data is safe with us. We have implemented strict controls to ensure that personal
                and sensitive information is treated with the highest level of confidentiality. By using our platform, you acknowledge and agree to
                the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Information We Collect -->
        <div class="Information">
            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                At the first stage, we only ask you for your name and contact details (such as email address and/or phone number). This allows us to communicate
                with you directly and understand your application needs. At this point, we do not request any sensitive personal information.<br/><br/>

                Once we establish contact and you confirm that you wish to proceed with an application, we will request further details. These may include your South 
                African ID document, address, academic results, guardianâ€™s details (ID and contact info), and other application-related documents. We will only collect 
                what is strictly necessary to complete the applications on your behalf.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Purpose of Data Collection -->
        <div class="Purpose">
            <h3>3. Purpose of Data Collection</h3>
            <p>
                The only reason we collect your personal information is to assist you with applications. Whether you are applying for admission to a university, scholarships,
                bursaries, or other educational opportunities, we use the information solely to submit accurate and complete applications on your behalf.<br/><br/>

                We do not sell, share, or use your information for marketing, advertising, or any unrelated activities. Every document and piece of information you provide 
                is linked directly to the application services you request. This ensures that your data is only used in ways that benefit you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Data Protection -->
        <div class="Protect">
            <h3>4. How We Store and Protect Your Information</h3>
            <p>
                Your personal information is stored securely, both electronically and physically, to prevent unauthorized access. Digital data is protected with passwords and
                encryption, while any physical copies (if necessary) are locked away. Only authorized staff members who are directly involved in handling applications are
                granted access to your information.<br/><br/>

                We also limit the retention of your data. Once your application process is complete, and you confirm that you no longer need our services, your documents and 
                personal details are safely deleted or destroyed. This ensures that we only hold your data for as long as it is necessary.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Sharing of Information -->
        <div class="Sharing">
            <h3>5. Sharing of Information</h3>
            <p>
                We only share your information with third parties when it is required for application purposes. For example, if we are applying to a university or scholarship
                organization on your behalf, they will receive the necessary documents to process your application. These organizations are trusted institutions that also have
                their own data protection measures in place.<br/><br/>

                We do not share your information with advertisers, marketers, or unrelated businesses. In fact, no one outside the application process will ever have access to 
                your data unless required by law (such as by a government authority). This ensures that your data stays within the intended scope.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Your Rights -->
        <div class="Rights">
            <h3>6. Your Rights Under POPIA</h3>
            <p>
                As a data subject, you have the right to know what information we have about you and how it is being used. You may request access to your personal data at any time,
                and you can ask us to correct or update incorrect details. You also have the right to request that we delete your personal data once it is no longer needed.<br/><br/>

                If you feel that your data is not being handled according to POPIA regulations, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Regulator of South Africa.
                We encourage open communication, and we will always respond promptly to your concerns before matters escalate.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Consent -->
        <div class="Consent">
            <h3>7. Consent and Communication</h3>
            <p>
                We will never collect sensitive personal data without your explicit consent. Before you provide any ID documents, academic results, or guardian information, we will clearly
                explain why it is required and how it will be used. You may decline to provide information at any time, but please note that this may limit our ability to complete your application.<br/><br/>

                We also rely on email or direct communication for the transfer of documents. By sending us your documents, you confirm that you consent to us processing your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Updates -->
        <div class="Updates">
            <h3>8. Updates to This Policy</h3>
            <p>
                We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in regulations or improvements to our data protection practices. If changes are made, we will notify you promptly via email or through our
                website so that you are always aware of how your data is being used.<br/><br/>

                We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy from time to time to stay informed. By continuing to use our services, you accept any updates or changes made.
